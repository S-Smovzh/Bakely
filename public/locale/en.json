  "about.appeal.secondPart": "Thank You so much for fourteen years of love and support. We truly cherish our neighborhoods and it’s hard to believe we’ve already been here fourteen years! It means everything to us that You’ve embraced Bakely and made us a part of the local fabric.",
  "about.appeal.thirdPart": "As many of You know, we met in school about 25 years ago (but who’s counting) with a pretty simple idea—to provide delicious moments and treats from Your local neighborhood bakery.",
  "about.appeal.fourthPart": "Each day at Bakely, everything is still made from scratch. From our (pretty well known) Icebox Cake to our (pretty darn well known) Red Velvet Cupcakes—it’s as real as our grandmothers used to make. For us, that smell when You walk into a real local bakery is almost as important as the taste. And we’re never going to lose that. For Bakely, it's all about real ingredients, authentic recipes, and real people making it happen.",
  "about.appeal.fifthPart": "Stop by our shops in Poshtova, Levoberezhna or Polytechnic — and let us take care of You. Join us, as we Celebrate Homemade.",

  "about.feedbacks.first": "Dude, I love Bakely. I know there's a ton of other bakeries nearby, but how can You resist the overwhelmingly cute seating area, amazingly perfect cupcakes, AND their delicious and NOT overly sweet cookies? I think Bakely has some of the best cupcakes in Kyiv, plus I like that it's a small business with bakers that seem to really care about the quality of their desserts.",
  "about.feedbacks.second.author": "Dove C.",
  "about.feedbacks.second": "Every time I come to Bakely I find something new to love! The staff is friendly and accommodating, and it always feels cozy in this shop. I especially love the apple pie, although it's only seasonal. I also love the lemon cupcakes and the butterscotch ginger cookies. All thumbs up!",
  "about.feedbacks.third.author": "Sherry S.",
  "about.feedbacks.third": "I stumbled across this cute bakery one day and was so pleasantly surprised by the wide selection of baked goods this little shop carries! They have a large variety of cupcakes and cakes as well as pies. I tried the banana pudding which I thought was very creamy, but not the type of creamy that makes You feel sick after.",

      "answer": "We offer a few 'gluten-friendly' items on our menu, however all of our foods are prepared in a common kitchen so we cannot guarantee that cross-contact with other gluten-containing products will not occur. As a result, we do not recommend our 'gluten-friendly' items for persons with Celiac Disease. Our 'gluten-friendly' offerings are designed for those with minor gluten sensitivities or those who prefer to avoid gluten for nutritional reasons. Our management team and service staff are not trained on the intricacies of celiac disease or gluten intolerance and cannot be expected to provide recommendations or other advice."
